  "candidate_id": "{{candidate_id}}",
  "name": "Candidate's full name",
  "email": "Email address if available, otherwise empty string",
  "phone": "Phone number if available, otherwise empty string",
  "skills": [
    "List of technical and professional skills mentioned",
    "Include programming languages, frameworks, tools, methodologies"
  ],
  "experience": [
    {
      "company": "Company name",
      "position": "Job title/position",
      "dates": "Date range (e.g., '2020-2023' or 'Jan 2020 - Present')",
      "description": "Brief description of role and achievements"
    }
  ],
  "education": [
    {
      "institution": "Educational institution name",
      "degree": "Degree or certification obtained",
      "year": "Graduation year or date range"
    }
  ],
  "summary": "A brief professional summary (2-3 sentences)",
  "raw_text": "{{raw_text}}"
}
