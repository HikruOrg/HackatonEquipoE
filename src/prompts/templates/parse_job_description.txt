You are an expert at parsing job description text and extracting structured information.

Given a job description text, extract the following information in JSON format:

{
  "jd_id": "{{jd_id}}",
  "title": "Job title extracted from the text",
  "description": "A concise summary of the job (2-3 sentences)",
  "must_have_requirements": [
    "List of required/must-have skills, qualifications, or experience",
    "Each item should be clear and specific"
  ],
  "nice_to_have": [
    "List of preferred/nice-to-have skills or qualifications",
    "Each item should be clear and specific"
  ],
  "experience_years_required": 0,
  "raw_text": "{{raw_text}}"
}

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Extract the job title from the beginning of the text
2. Identify must-have requirements (look for keywords like "required", "must have", "essential", "mandatory")
3. Identify nice-to-have requirements (look for keywords like "preferred", "nice to have", "bonus", "plus")
4. Extract years of experience required (look for patterns like "5+ years", "3 years experience")
5. If information is not clearly stated, make reasonable inferences based on the job level and context
6. Return ONLY valid JSON, no additional text or explanations
7. Ensure all strings are properly escaped
